# FORTRAN REPOSITORY


* Here are my **FORTRAN** codes made during the master's classes at the Federal University of Par√°.
* I have 3 pastes:
1. aval_1 : It consists of the basic part of the language. It goes from the basics of declaring variables to the loop structure.
2. aval_2 : It consists of the intermediate part. It goes from opening files to using modules.
3. aval_3 : Some math problems in depth, using everything learned in the other modules.
